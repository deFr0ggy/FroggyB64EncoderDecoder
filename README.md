# FroggyB64EncoderDecoder
A very basic C# Windows Forms Application capable of doing the following two things only. 

- Base64 Encoding
- Base64 Decoding

The other two buttons which i have added are to do the following. 

1. Clean the input and output form.
2. Exit the program.

The entire code is open source and anyone can use the same to make achanges or enhancement, consider it as a boiler plate for upcoming few projects i am working on. 

The compiled binaries can be found in the below location. 

1. [Debug](/B64EncoderDecoder/bin/Debug/B64EncoderDecoder.exe)
1. [Release](/B64EncoderDecoder/bin/Release/B64EncoderDecoder.exe)
